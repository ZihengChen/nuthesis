\chapter{$Br(W)$ measurement and LU Test}
\label{sec:analysis}


The chapter presents the physics analysis of $Br(W)$ measurement and LU test based on the CMS Run2016 dataset. 
The works included in the chapter are done together with Nathaniel Odell, postdoc fellow at Northwestern University.
Nate is in charge of the shape analysis and has provided me many advice in the counting analysis. 

% The Section~\ref{sec:analysis:dataset} gives a description of the CMS dataset and the Monte Carlo simulation in the CMS Run 2016 used in the analysis. Section~\ref{sec:analysis:selection} summarizes the criteria of the object and event selection. Section~\ref{sec:analysis:background} explains the data driven method for the estimation of QCD background. Section~\ref{sec:analysis:method} discusses about the approach to extract the W decay branching fraction from the yields in the counting analysis. Section~\ref{sec:analysis:systematics} lists the systematical uncertainties considered in the $Br(W)$ measurement and the approach to combine them. Section~\ref{sec:analysis:result} presents the final result of the $Br(W)$ measurement and test of LU
