\chapter{Measurements of W Branching Fractions and Test of Lepton Universality with the CMS 2016 Dataset}
\label{sec:analysis}


This chapter presents a precision measurement of W branching fractions with the CMS 2016 dataset. Lepton universality is tested by taking the ratio of W leptonic branching fractions of different lepton generations. This measurement is done in collaboration with Nathaniel Odell, postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University, who is in charge of the shape analysis. 


This chapter is structured as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A description of the analyzed datasets and simulation;
    \item The selection of physics objects and events;
    \item The calibrations and corrections;
    \item The estimation of backgrounds;
    \item The methods for extracting the branching fractions;
    \item Estimation of systematic uncertainties;
    \item Results of measured W branching fractions and a test of lepton universality.
\end{enumerate}
