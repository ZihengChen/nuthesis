\chapter{Precision Measurement of W Branching Fractions and Test of Lepton Universality with the CMS 2016 Dataset}
\label{sec:analysis}


The chapter presents A precision measurement of W branching fractions with the CMS 2016 dataset. Lepton universality is tested by taking the ratio of W leptonic branching fractions of different lepton generations. This measurement is done in collaboration with Nathaniel Odell, postdoc fellow at Northwestern University, who is in charge of the shape analysis. 

% The Section~\ref{sec:analysis:dataset} gives a description of the CMS dataset and the Monte Carlo simulation in the CMS Run 2016 used in the analysis. Section~\ref{sec:analysis:selection} summarizes the criteria of the object and event selection. Section~\ref{sec:analysis:background} explains the data driven method for the estimation of QCD background. Section~\ref{sec:analysis:method} discusses about the approach to extract the W decay branching fraction from the yields in the counting analysis. Section~\ref{sec:analysis:systematics} lists the systematical uncertainties considered in the $Br(W)$ measurement and the approach to combine them. Section~\ref{sec:analysis:result} presents the final result of the $Br(W)$ measurement and test of LU

\chapter{Supporting Studies for the Measurement of W Branching Fractions}
\label{sec:app}

A few studies have be conducted to complete the $B^W$ measurement. This chapter presents some of the key studies:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The measurement of b-tag efficiency in the simulation;
    \item The measurement of the scale factor for single electron trigger efficiency;
    \item The measurement of the scale factor for jet faking hadronic tau;
    \item Uncertainty of reweighting $B(\tau \to  \rm{hadrons})$;
    \item Trigger test of the trailing leptons;
    \item Dedicated MC samples for the \ttbar theoretical systematics;
    \item Calculation of Ratios of branching fractions;
    \item Estimation of QCD in the $l\tau$ and $l\rm{jet}$ channel.
\end{enumerate}
