\chapter{$B(W)$ measurement and Test of Lepton Universality}
\label{sec:analysis}


The chapter presents the physics analysis of $Br(W)$ measurement and LU test based on the CMS Run2016 dataset. 
The works included in the chapter are done collaboratively with Nathaniel Odell, Postdoc Fellow at Northwestern University, 
who is in charge of the shape analysis. 

% The Section~\ref{sec:analysis:dataset} gives a description of the CMS dataset and the Monte Carlo simulation in the CMS Run 2016 used in the analysis. Section~\ref{sec:analysis:selection} summarizes the criteria of the object and event selection. Section~\ref{sec:analysis:background} explains the data driven method for the estimation of QCD background. Section~\ref{sec:analysis:method} discusses about the approach to extract the W decay branching fraction from the yields in the counting analysis. Section~\ref{sec:analysis:systematics} lists the systematical uncertainties considered in the $Br(W)$ measurement and the approach to combine them. Section~\ref{sec:analysis:result} presents the final result of the $Br(W)$ measurement and test of LU

\chapter{Supplement Studies for the $B(W)$ measurement}

A few studies have be conducted to supplement the $Br(W)$ Analysis. This appendix includes 
\begin{itemize}
    \item measurement of b-tag efficiency in the simulation;
    \item measurement of the scale factor for single electron trigger efficiency;
    \item measurement of $j \to tau$ scale factor;
    \item reweight of $B(\tau \to  \rm{hadrons})$;
    \item trigger test of the trailing leptons;
    \item dedicated MC samples for the \ttbar theoretical systematics;
    \item ratios of branching fractions;
    \item estimation of QCD in the $l\tau$ and $l\rm{jet}$ channel. 
\end{itemize}
