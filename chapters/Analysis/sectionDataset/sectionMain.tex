\section{Dataset and Simulated Events}
\label{sec:analysis:dataset}


\subsection{Data}
\label{sec:analysis:dataset:data}

In this analysis, data is selected based on the presence of at least one muon or one electron. The single muon dataset requires that events contain at least one muon with $\pt > 25\GeV$ and passing the loose track isolation criterion, $\rm Iso_{track} < 0.1$. The single electron dataset requires that there be at least one electron satisfying the requirement that $\pt > 30\GeV$ and that it passes the tight identification requirements as defined by the EGamma POG.  The specific dataset names and the associated integrated luminosities are listed in Table~\ref{tab:analysis:dataset:data2016}.

\noindent Run ranges where data quality is determined to be insufficient are filtered removed from the datset by applying a luminosity mask. The following file is provided in JSON format from the CMS PPD group:

\texttt{Cert\_271036-284044\_13TeV\_23Sep2016ReReco\_Collisions16\_JSON.txt}

\noindent The full dataset consists of 35.9\fbinv of integrated luminosity~\cite{cms:lumi2016:CMS-PAS-LUM-17-001}




\subsection{Simulated Dataset}
\label{sec:analysis:dataset:simulation}

Simulated datasets are used for modelling the major SM processes, including SM diboson, $\PW/\PZ/\PGg$ associated with jets, single-top and \ttbar. The background from multijet QCD is estimated by a data-driven approach discussed in section~\ref{sec:analysis:background} The simulated samples used in modelling the background and signal are shown in table~\ref{tab:analysis:dataset:mc2016}.  The production of the samples was carried during the Summer 2016 campaingn and the production of the mini Analysis Oriented Data format (miniAOD) was done using CMSSW release \texttt{8\_0\_26\_patch2}. The same release was used for processing both the data and the simulated samples. Lepton universality is assumed for the simulated datasets, namely $ \BWl = 10.8\%$. To account for the deviation from the data, some reweightings of the simulated dataset are applied, commonly including reweightings for pile-up, top \pt, \WW \pt and \PZ \pt.
