\chapter{Clustering for HGCAL Reconstruction}
\label{sec:relatedworks}

This chapter discusses CLUE clustering algorithm to reconstruct 2D layer clusters, followed by an introduction of TICL that 
links the layer clusters to form trackersters for particle candidates. This chapter is based on published results in 
\cite{cluepaper}, \cite{Chen:2020mih}, \cite{DiPilato:2020mqs}.
