The leptonic and inclusive hadronic branching fractions of the W boson are measured using $35.9 \; \rm{fb}^{-1}$ of data collected at $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ during the 2016 run of CMS.  Events highly enriched in the production of top quark pairs are selected based on the decay products of the concomitant W boson pairs. The branching fractions for W boson to electrons, muons, taus, and hadrons are determined to be $ (10.77 \pm 0.10)\%$, $(10.91 \pm 0.08)\%$, $(10.89 \pm 0.21)\%$, and $(67.42 \pm 0.28)\%$, respectively. These values support the lepton universality for weak interactions. Based on these values, the sum square of CKM matrix elements is calculated to be $1.991\pm 0.019$ and $V_{cs}$ is calculated to be $0.97 \pm 0.01$.
