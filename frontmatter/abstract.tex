The leptonic and inclusive hadronic branching fractions of the W boson are studied using 35.9 \fbinv of proton collision data collected at $\sqrt{s}=13~\TeV$ during the 2016 run of the CMS experiment. Events characterized by the production of two W boson pairs, mostly from top quark pair decays, are selected based on their leptonic decay final states. The branching fractions of the W boson decaying into electron, muon, and tau lepton final states are determined to be $(10.77 \pm 0.10)\%$, $(10.91 \pm 0.08)\%$, and $(10.89 \pm 0.21)\%$, respectively, supporting the hypothesis of lepton universality for the weak interaction. Under the lepton universality assumption, the branching fraction for W boson decaying to hadrons is determined to be $(67.38 \pm 0.22)\%$. From these results, three standard model quantities are subsequently derived: the sum square of elements in the first two rows of the Cabibbo--Kobayashi--Maskawa (CKM) matrix  $\sum{\left|V_{ij}\right|^{2}} = 1.991 \pm 0.019$, the CKM element $V_{cs} = 0.970 \pm 0.008$, and the strong coupling constant at the W mass pole $\alpha_{S}(m_\mathrm{W}) = 0.099 \pm 0.026$.
