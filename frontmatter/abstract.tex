The branching fractions of the W boson are measured using data collected at $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ during the 2016 run of CMS.  Events highly enriched in the production of top quark pairs are selected based on the decay products of the concomitant W boson pairs. The branching fractions for W boson to electrons, muons, taus, and hadrons are determined to be $?? \pm ??$, $?? \pm ??$, $?? \pm ??$, and $?? \pm ??$, respectively.  A test of lepton universality is carried out based on the leptonic branching fractions, and violation of lepton universality is excluded at the ??\% level.
