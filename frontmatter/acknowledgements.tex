\acknowledgements

First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest and most sincere gratitude to my supervisor \textbf{Mayda Velasco}, Professor in the Physics Department, Northwestern University, who provides me with excellent guidance and training to explore and research the wonderful world of particle physics. 

Next, I would like to thank \textbf{Nathaniel Odell}, a postdoc fellow in the Physics Department, Northwestern University, and the colleague I collaborate the most closely with on this thesis, for providing me enormous support and advice during the studies in this thesis. Without him, this thesis would not be completed. 

Also, many people within the CMS have given me beneficial guidance. I could not appreciate more the ARC committee members and the SMP colleagues for sharing their constructive suggestions and insights about our analysis work. Besides, I also want to acknowledge my HGCAL DPG colleagues and BRIL BCM1F colleagues for providing me with marvelous opportunities and experiences on the detector research and developing for the CMS.

Finally, I would like to thank my family members, including my wife \textbf{Shuyuan Hu}, who is currently studying for her Ph.D. in Heidelberg, Germany, as well as my parents in China. Despite the long distance, the love, joy, happiness, and support they brought to me during my doctoral journey is one of the most invaluable and beautiful things that ever happen to me in my life.
