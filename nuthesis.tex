%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% DISCLAIMER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% In spite of the effort to accommodate this template and the nuthesis
% class to the official requirements of the university to write a 
% Ph.D. dissertation, it is not possible to guarantee that it will 
% always work, and the author of the dissertation remains responsible
% for checking that such requirements are actually fulfilled by 
% his/her final work.

% The nuthesis class is based on % amsbook.cls.
