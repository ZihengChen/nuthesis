    \begin{itemize}
        \item For decades, LEP's result is the most precise and only \BWl measurement, showing $2.6\sigma$ tension with SM LU.

        \item We provide a new measurement with CMS using LHC 13\TeV collisions. Three individual leptonic branching fractions are measured simultaneous.
        \begin{itemize}
        \smaller
            \item  shape: \BWemt = 10.83(10)\%, 10.94(08)\%,10.77(21)\%
            \item  counting: \BWemt = 11.15(27)\%, 11.13(22)\%,10.63(65)\%
        \end{itemize}
        \item Counting analysis is limited by the tau identification systematics.
        \item Shape analysis is the currently the most precise measurement. 
        \begin{itemize}
        \smaller
            \item use \pt distribution to discriminate $\PW\to\PGtl$ and $\PW \to \ell$
            \item use extended data regions to constrain the tau related systematics.  
        \end{itemize}
        \item Two analysis are consist. SM LU is agreed.
        
        \item Assuming partial LU, $R^{\PW}_{\PGt/(\Pe,\PGm)} = 1.002(19)$ 
        \item Assuming fully LU, $\BWl=10.89(08)\%$ and $\BWh= 67.32(23)\%$, with which three SM quantities are derived
        \begin{itemize}
        \smaller
            \item \alpS = 0.094(33),  \sumCKM = 1.991(19), \absVcs = 0.969(11)
        \end{itemize}
